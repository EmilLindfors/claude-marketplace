4. **Provide context**:
   - Highlight the changelog format and structure
   - Point out different change categories (Added, Changed, Fixed, etc.)
   - Show examples of well-formatted entries
5. **Offer next steps**:
   - Suggest using /changelog-add if they need to add an entry
   - Point out where new entries should be added
